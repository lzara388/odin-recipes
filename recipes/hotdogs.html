    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is an elevated version of the hotdogs you're used to getting at the ball game or at your neighborhood BBQ.
        It's a bacon wrapped frank topped with carmelized onions, jalapeno peppers, freshly diced tomatoes, ketchup, mayo and mustard.
        This style of hotdog was curated by the food vendors in Mexico, but has made its way to the streets of LA and many other food festivals 
        across the United States. The great thing about this dish is how customizable it is. The bacon wrapped hotdog is a blank canvas for whatever
        toppings your heart desires.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 case of your favorite hotdog brand</li>
        <li>1 packet of your favorite bacon</li>
        <li>1 large white onion</li>
        <li>2 roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>1 packet of hotdog buns</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by tightly wrapping you hotdogs in the bacon. Once you have finished 
            wrapping, place a cast iron on medium-high heat. Place the wrapped hotdogs 
            into the heated pan, making sure to not overlap any hotdogs. Cook the hotdogs until crispy on each side
            then remove them from the pan and place of a plate with a paper towel to drain any excess oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take you large white onion and slice it into slivers. Turn the heat down to low-medium and place them in the 
            same pan where you just removed your hotdogs. Cook onions until they caramelize, then remove from pan. Add in you whole jalapenos, and quickly pan fry. 
            Remove and sprikle a little salt and lemon, and move to the side. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, in the same cast iron, toast your buns in the remaining oil. Now you're all set to assemble. Add diced tomato, your 
            caramelized onions, jalapeno, ketchup, and mayo. <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
